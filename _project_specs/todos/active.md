## [FOCUS-001] Fix tier-classifier under-rating of decision/question prompts

**Status:** done (2026-07-08) — few-shot mitigation applied, 5/6 empirical; residual (context-blind lookup-shaped decisions) logged to observatory as mitigation #1, still open
**Priority:** high
**Source:** observatory "Tier classifier under-rates discussion-heavy prompts" (ADR-0002 open thread); observed live 2026-07-08 — "what's next for tessera?" classified HAIKU.

### Problem
`hooks/tier-classify-hook` classifies by task-type keywords on the bare prompt.
Short decision/strategy questions ("what's next?", "should we go global?") match
no keyword and fall through to HAIKU/SONNET — under-rating the most
reasoning-heavy turns exactly when stakes are highest. Sanctioned fix path:
ADR-0002 re-evaluate trigger ("misclassification costs quality → boundary
few-shot examples").

### Approach
Prompt-engineering the classifier (smallest diff, reversible): add a
"judge reasoning demanded, not prompt length" rule, extend OPUS to open
design/strategy decisions, and add balanced few-shot examples (short decision Q
→ OPUS; short trivial lookup → HAIKU) so length stops being the signal.

### Validation
Re-classify this session's real prompts (decision questions) — must land OPUS,
while a trivial lookup stays HAIKU. Empirical eval against local qwen, not hope.

## [FOCUS-002] Sweep the observatory (18 open threads)

**Status:** pending (after FOCUS-001)
**Priority:** medium

Triage all Investigating/Watching/Pending entries. Its own rule: >6mo untouched
= evidence it doesn't matter. Promote what earned its keep to ADRs, reject the
rest, name re-open conditions. Expected to spawn follow-on work — that's the
point. Known input already: duplicate hook copies (`hooks/` vs `.claude/scripts/`),
an F-003-shaped drift risk surfaced during FOCUS-001.

## Parked for discussion (not started)

- **Roadmap Tier 1** (runtime observability / verifiable contracts / human
  escalation, `_project_specs/00-autonomous-engineering-roadmap.md`). Build-more-
  framework vision; rationale dates to an April 2026 chat. Discuss whether current
  dogfood pull justifies it before committing — do NOT start speculatively.
